      The Ace Alpha is meant to help us understand whether or not a solution like this will help you feel more confident for your next interview! We've all been there, 10 minutes before the most important interview yet and feeling super nervous. 
      So we really hope that after this, you can easily communicate your unique talents :) 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this alpha, we will ask you three super common interview questions that typically throw people off (including ourselves). 
      We then will send you a feedback report on your videos within 1-2 days. 
    </p>
